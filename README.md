    A Framework for Decentralized Federated Learning
    <br>
  </p>
</p>

## About the project

Fedstellar is a modular, adaptable and extensible framework for creating centralized and decentralized architectures using Federated Learning. Also, the framework enables the creation of a standard approach for developing, deploying, and managing federated learning applications.
<br><br>
The framework enables developers to create distributed applications that use federated learning algorithms to improve user experience, security, and privacy. It provides features for managing data, managing models, and managing federated learning processes. It also provides a comprehensive set of tools to help developers monitor and analyze the performance of their applications.
<br>
<br>
The framework is developed by Enrique Tomás Martínez Beltrán in collaboration with the University of Murcia and Armasuisse.
